TITTLE: First one-page (a project for ambitious people from Kodilla).

TECHNOLOGIES USED: html5, css3, rwd, jQuery.

DESCRIPTION: It is my first one-page project (from .psd to HTML). Here is
a simple grid (col-1, col-2 etc.) that helped me create this layout. There are
some links which redirect a user to the Google "site"? (e.g.in the image-section).
In ooder to  redirect I used jQuery in a separate file which is called script.js.
By clicking the buttons at the bottom of the page, there appears a small Modal which
you can close or redirect to the Google. The modal is written in a separate
file which is called modal.css. The biggest problem was adjusting the height
for small devices because at the beginning I used static properties(height and width)
but I learned about min/max-height(width) and it sloved my problems.
